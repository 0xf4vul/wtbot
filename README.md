WTBOT
The Simple Web Traffic Bot.
This software has been developed for educational purposes only. I assume no liability for damages of any kind resulting from the use of the WTBOT.
A proxy list is required for use.
Automatic visit to the specified URL will continue as long as proxy servers exist in the proxy file. Proxy servers are required to make the detection of the bots through the web host. The bot has 26 browser identifiers. Another technique that WTBOT uses is the pretending of referencing links from websites and search engines like Google, Bing, Ask, Yahoo, CNET and theverse others. Let's chop the planet.
